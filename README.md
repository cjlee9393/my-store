# MyStore

This project is an e-commerce website – an application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Usage

The project requires only `npm install` and `ng serve` to install and launch the application.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project features

This application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

- **Product list** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
- **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
- **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
- **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
